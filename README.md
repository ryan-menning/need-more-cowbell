## Dinner Wheel

Unfortunately this is a description of what my project was supposed to be. The dinner wheel
was intended to allow the user to select a number of recipes from the Recipes page that would
then be added to a festival like spinning wheel. As the wheel turned and randomly stopped on a recipe
that recipe would then be added to the menu.

My project falls way short of my expectations and I know that is due to how late I started on it.

Even with the site's unfunctional state the following might be considered as a demonstration of my 
basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

### CSS FEATURES
- A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes

### JAVASCRIPT FEATURES
    I'm thinking I did a combo of the two below. The populateDays function creates an array, determines the current day and then  
    lists the weekdays in order on the 'menu' starting with the current day
- Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page
- Create a Javascript loop that dynamically displays HTML on your page

### ADDITIONAL FEATURES
- Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code.
    - I heard in the last class that the hamburger button could be considered a CSS feature and Javascript feature
- Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views.
- I'm not sure if the :hover selector counts towards anything. The recipe photos change as they are moused over. Not helpful for a touch screen I know.


### Notes
    The photos used are a combination of personal photos and photos pulled from the internet. I did not get permission nor cite for some of the photos
    knowing that this project would not be released to the public. I hope that's not a big faux pas.
